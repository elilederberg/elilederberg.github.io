        <div class="sec1 dep">
         <span data-target=".dep-option" class="button">Depressed</span>
        </div>

        <div class="dep-option text dep hide">If you’re feeling depressed, try and move around. Try not to stay in a dark room and get out in a well lit space with a lot of sunlight. Attempt to do some form of exercise or activities that you feel passionate about or spend time with other people, contact with others while feeling this way is key. Try listening to some music or having a bit to eat, food and water are very important for you and your body. </div>

        <div class="sec1 ang">
        <span data-target=".ang-option" class="button">Angry</span>
        </div>

         <div class="ang-option text ang hide">If you’re feeling angry, try and relax, maybe even take a quick nap or rest. You could watch some television or a movie on your laptop, which can help to take your mind off of things and focus on something else. You should go into a room that is darker and you can also try listening to some relaxing music. If you’re feeling up to it try and take some deep breathes, as cliche as it is, it does help.</div>

        <div class="sec1 anx">
        <span data-target=".anx-option" class="button">Anxious</span>
        </div>

         <div class="anx-option text anx hide">If you’re feeling anxious, try and take your mind off of things. Read a book or watch a movie. Try and focus on things your passionate, maybe that’s drawing, or cooking. Either way try and focus on these things and lose your self in them. Listening to music can be very helpful along with deep breathing and even meditation.</div>

        <div class="sec1 man">
        <span data-target=".man-option" class="button">Maniac</span>
        </div>

         <div class="man-option text man hide">If you’re feeling maniac, make sure to go find another person. Try and have this person help to balance you out. Try and do some activities that you enjoy doing on a regular basis. If you can spend some time outdoors. But do your best not to be alone during this period, being in the presence of other people can be very helpful if you’re experiencing this sensation.</div>
      
        <div class="sec1 eup">
        <span data-target=".eup-option" class="button">Euphoric</span>
        </div>

         <div class="eup-option text eup hide">Try and get yourself to calm down, this feeling is only going to be temporary and will fade away relatively quickly. Try and do activities you enjoy or spend time with other people that can help to balance you out. Try deep breathing as well.</div>
