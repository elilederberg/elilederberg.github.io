<h1>Coping Strategies</h1>

<li>
Control stress. Do what you can to simplify your life and relieve stress in your work and personal life. See if your spouse, family members, and friends can help with household responsibilities. "If you have a job that requires crazy hours and lots of travel, you may want to switch to a less-stressful job," suggests Dr. First. Stress-management techniques, such as meditation, visualization, and yoga, can also help.

	<br>
	<br>

<li>
Practice healthy sleep habits. Being overtired can trigger mania in some people. Relax before bed by listening to soothing music, reading, or taking a warm bath. Experts also recommend that you make your bedroom a calming place and use it only for sleep and sex. Be disciplined about your sleep habits. 

	<br>
	<br>

<li>
Get moving. Studies show that regular exercise can help improve mood. Start slowly by taking a walk around the neighborhood. Gradually work up to exercising on most days of the week.

	<br>
	<br>

<li>
Write it down. Keep a journal that makes note of big events, stresses, how much sleep you're getting, and what you're eating and drinking. Over time, you may see patterns emerging. By knowing what your triggers are, you may be able to prepare for times when you might be most vulnerable to mood swings.
